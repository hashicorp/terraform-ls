### Use-cases
<!---
In order to properly evaluate a feature request, it is necessary to understand the use-cases for it.

Please describe below the _end goal_ you are trying to achieve that has led you to request this feature.

Please keep this section focused on the problem and not on the suggested solution. We'll get to that in a moment, below!

### Attempted Solutions
<!---
If you've already tried to solve the problem within server's existing features and found a limitation that prevented you from succeeding, please describe it below in as much detail as possible.

Ideally, this would include real configuration snippets that you tried, actions you performed (e.g. autocompletion in a particular position in that snippet), and what results you got in each case.

Please remove any sensitive information such as passwords before sharing configuration snippets and command lines.

### Proposal
<!---
If you have an idea for a way to address the problem via a change to existing features, please describe it below.

In this section, it's helpful to include specific examples of how what you are suggesting might look in configuration files, or on the command line, since that allows us to understand the full picture of what you are proposing.

If you're not sure of some details, don't worry! When we evaluate the feature request we may suggest modifications as necessary to work within the design constraints of Language Server.
