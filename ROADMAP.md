# Q3 2020 Roadmap

Each quarter, the team will highlight areas of focus for our work and upcoming research.
Each release will include necessary tasks that lead to the completion of the stated goals as well as community pull requests, enhancements, and features that are not highlighted in the roadmap. This upcoming calendar quarter (Jul-Sep 2020) we will be prioritizing the following areas of work:

## Currently In Progress
### Expanded Completion Capabilities
The terraform-ls language server supports basic schema-driven completion. We plan to introduce additional completion capabilities, including completion for:
 
- Modules
- Variables
- Locals
- Expressions
- Built-ins
 
## Planned
### Diagnostics
Add HCL and syntax error-checking to the language server
 
### Linting (External Diagnostics)
Investigate integration of terraform-ls to other diagnostic helpers, such as tflint
