NOTE:

Starting with this release, we are including a copy of our license file in all packaged versions of our releases, such as the release .zip files. If you are consuming these files directly and would prefer to extract the one terraform-ls file instead of extracting everything, you need to add an extra argument specifying the file to extract, like this:

```
unzip terraform-ls_0.33.2_linux_amd64.zip terraform-ls
```
