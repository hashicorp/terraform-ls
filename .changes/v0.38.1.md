## 0.39.0 (06 October 2025)

NOTES: 

* Implemented support for the new top-level `actions` block, enabling providers to define and execute imperative actions outside of Terraform's standard CRUD model. This allows users to codify use cases such as invoking AWS Lambda functions or creating CloudFront invalidations directly within their Terraform configurations. Actions can be triggered through resource lifecycles or via the `-invoke` CLI flag. See [#37553](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/37553) for more details.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Improved code completion and validation for Terraform `actions` blocks through dynamic schema support. ([#2035](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/issues/2035))
