## 0.34.0 (15 July 2024)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Add initial support for Terraform Stacks files and Deployment files. This provides block and attribute completion, hover, and diagnostics along with syntax validation for Terraform Stacks and Deployment files ([#1745](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/issues/1745))
* Add documentation for using vim with YouCompleteMe ([#1718](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/issues/1718))
* Enable completion for all locally installed remote modules ([#1760](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/issues/1760))
* Re-architect the language server for improved performance and resource utilization ([#1667](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/issues/1667))

This marks the completion of a major refactoring effort. The language server will now start up much faster and use less resources, especially on larger workspaces. We achieve this by doing less work during the initial walk of a workspace. Instead, we only parse modules with open files. Whenever a file of a module is opened, we schedule all the jobs needed to understand the contents of that directory (and the referenced modules).

INTERNAL:

* Introduce a workflow that checks for changelog entries ([#1759](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/issues/1759))
* Split internal modules state into separate features ([#1667](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/issues/1667))
