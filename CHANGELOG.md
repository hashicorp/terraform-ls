**SECURITY:**

This release is signed with a new GPG key (ID `72D7468F`), unlike all previous releases which were signed with (now revoked) key (ID `348FFC4C`). Old releases were *temporarily* re-signed with the new key, but that key will be removed in coming weeks or months.

[Read more about the related security event HCSEC-2021-12](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2021-12-codecov-security-event-and-hashicorp-gpg-key-exposure/23512/2).

Users of the [Terraform VS Code extension](https://github.com/hashicorp/vscode-terraform) will need to upgrade to [`2.10.1`](https://github.com/hashicorp/vscode-terraform/blob/v2.10.1/CHANGELOG.md#2101-2021-04-28) before auto-upgrading to this LS version.

 - Report deprecated completion items as such ([#337](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/337))
 - Preloaded schemas now include partner providers in addition to official ones ([#341](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/341))

NOTES:

 - Only official (legacy) providers will be completed in `provider` block completion. Partner providers currently require corresponding entry in `required_providers` block, read https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/issues/370 to understand why and how we plan to address this inconvenient behaviour.
 - Preloaded schemas are now being generated at release time (as opposed to being committed to the repo). Therefore availability of these schemas is dependent on particular release process [tracked in this repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml). This may interest anyone who does not use the official builds from `releases.hashicorp.com` and has its own build process. Plain `go get` still compiles and runs server correctly, however it won't automatically generate and embed the schemas. ([#341](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/341))

INTERNAL:

 - Use Go `1.15.2` (previously `1.14.9`) ([#348](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/348))
